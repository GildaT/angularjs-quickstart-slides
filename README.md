##WARNING: this project is at an early stage of development

Anyway, if you want to try it:

- clone the project and `cd` into the folder
- from your terminal run `npm install && bower install`
- run `grunt serve` to launch the server
- start creating your slides editing app/views/presentation.html

When you are done editing, run `grunt build`, this will create a "dist" folder. This is your final product. Enjoy!
